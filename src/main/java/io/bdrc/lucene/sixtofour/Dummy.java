/**
 * Dummy.READER is required to migrate these 3 classes from Lucene 6 to 4:
 * SkrtWordTokenizer, SkrtSyllableTokenizer, SanskritAnalyzer;
 * More precisely, Lucene 6 has Analyzer and Tokenizer constructors taking no arguments,
 * that set the `input' member to the (private) Tokenizer.ILLEGAL_STATE_READER;
 * OTOH Lucene 4 requires at least the provision of a Reader object,
 * (and using Tokenizer.ILLEGAL_STATE_READER is not an option as it is private)
 * Hence -- the need for a Dummy.READER, which will throw upon invocation
 * of its read() or close() method.
